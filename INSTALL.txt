Freeboard Notes

This is the main freeboard server, which runs in java on the Raspberry Pi. The arduino based ArduIMU and FreeboardPLC connect to this via a (powered) USB hub. Using a decent powered hub is important - see the Raspberry Pi site.

This has been developed in Eclipse Juno, with maven3 and zk plugins (among others)

This project is still fairly new, so if you are developing, expect some pain getting it all setup/building/etc. Email me for help.

Hardware:
	Raspberry Pi (Model B, 256 Mb RAM) - currently using hard-fp image (for oracle JDK8-ea java for ARM)
	
			sudo apt-get install git-core
		
		#install the firmware updates from hexxeh according to https://github.com/Hexxeh/rpi-update
		
			sudo rpi-update
		
		#Turn on overclocking and set various options; desktop on boot off, ssh on, overclock on high, memory on minimum GPU options.
			sudo raspi-config
		
		#make sure to 'sudo apt-get install gdal-bin python-gdal imagemagick'
		#add sun (Oracle) jdk8 manually, into /home/pi/jdk1.8.0
		#create dir /home/pi/freeboard
			mkdir /home/pi/freeboard
		#copy the following from your dev system to /home/pi/freeboard
		 	 	conf/  
             	freeboard/  
		 		install.sh  
		 		logs/  
		 		mapcache/  - you create this when you import charts, I currently only have NZ charts, I will import a world map shortly, so you can at least see something basic.
		 		start.sh  
		 		stop.sh  
		 		# rename the freeboard-server*with-dependancies.jar!
		 		target/freeboard-server.jar  
		
		cd /home/pi/freeboard
		./start.sh

	Arduino - Mega 1260 - load as per  freeboardPLC project
		connect via USB

	ArduIMU - load as per FreeBoard ArduIMU project
		connect via USB
		
	Misc NMEA devices
		connect via USB

Baud rates for attached devices:
	In conf/freeboard.cfg there is support for configuring baud rates per USB port. These entries control this
		
		# the port range thats scanned for devices - yours may be ttyACM0, edit to suit
		freeboard.serial.ports=/dev/ttyUSB0,/dev/ttyUSB1,/dev/ttyUSB2
		#default baud is 38400, this sets default for all ports to something else
		freeboard.serial.port.baud=38400
		#this sets ttyUSB0 to 9600, others stay at the default 
		freeboard.serial.port.baud.ttyUSB0=9600
		
		Be careful with the last one, it may not work as you expect, as devices dont always get the same ports. 
		Using udev rules in linux fixes this, but its complex - email me. 
		
Connecting from a web browser:
	
	Assuming IP_ADDRESS is either the ip address or dns name of your raspberry pi (eg your boat name)
	freeboard will be available on http://IP_ADDRESS:8080/freeboard
	
	See the info in CHART_INSTALL.txt, and DNS_NOTES.txt, or you will suffer the 'Processing' message forever - aaargh!!

Hostapd notes:
  Use a supported wifi dongle - try RT5370 USB - works but seems to suffer arbitrary freezes (possibly due to a known driver problem)
  I am trying an atheros ath9k based dongle - its good now. If you are really stuck, use ethernet for dev, and a real Wifi access point on the boat for now.

  'sudo apt-get install wpasupplicant usbutils wireless-tools iw hostapd dnsmasq'
  'iw list' must return 
	      Supported interface modes:
                 * IBSS
                 * managed
                 * AP         ** wont work if you dont get this!!**
                 * AP/VLAN
                 * WDS
                 * monitor
                 * mesh point
